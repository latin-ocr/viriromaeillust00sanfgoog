“The summoning 00000 0000000000 afforded a fortunate opportunity for
» 000 discussion 00 00 important question not included in the memoran-
dum, namely, what authors and what parts 00 authors, should constitute
the reading 00 000 preparatory sobools? Thus far, the collegas have in
general left the schools very little liberty 00 choice. Three authors bave
been named by every college that prescribes set work. 00 00000 three 000
0001000, 00, 00 000 should perhaps say, the least difficult, 10 000000. Hence
it has come about that 000 Gallie War 10 very commonly used as the first
reading-book in Latin. 000 American sobools are probably the only
ones in the world 00 which this 10 0000. Το0 000100 10 00 unfortunate one.
The book is altogether too difficult for beginners; it is too exclusively
military 10 00000000 to be generally interesting; its vocabulary 10 000
largely restricted, from 000 000000 00000 subject, 00 marchen, sieges‚ and
battles, to afford the best introduction to subsequeut reading; and, final·
ly, it 0000000 human life 00 000 few points to he morally helpful and sig·
nificant. The Conference therefore makes two recommendatione: first,
that some easy reading, sucb 00 Gradatim, Eutropius, or the Viri Romae,
beusedas a 0000010100 from the introductory work 00 000 beginner's
book to the regular reading 00 0 0100010; end second, that at least 0 por-
tion 00 000 time now usually given to 000000 00 taken from him and
given to Nepos.”
